# P&Urules: Guidelines for Managing Generated Plan/Update Markdown Files in Cursor

This document outlines the recommended practices for handling the planX.md and updateX.md files generated by the external Large Language Model (LLM) within your Cursor IDE environment. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure optimal project organization, maintain clear historical context, and facilitate effective collaboration.

## 1. Purpose of Plan & Update Files

**planX.md**: These files serve as strategic blueprints and action plans. They detail the next phases of development, outlining features, architectural decisions, step-by-step implementation guides, and debugging considerations. They are forward-looking.

**updateX.md**: These files function as codebase analysis reports and synchronization points. They summarize the current state of the codebase, compare it against the latest plan, identify discrepancies, and confirm alignment. They are backward-looking (analyzing current state) and forward-looking (setting immediate next steps).

## 2. File Naming Convention & Location

**Naming**: Always use the planX.md and updateX.md format, where X is a sequentially increasing integer (e.g., plan1.md, plan2.md, update1.md, update2.md).

**Location**: Store these files in a dedicated docs/ directory at the root of your project (e.g., Amplifyd/docs/). This keeps project documentation organized and separate from source code.

## 3. Integration into Cursor IDE Workflow

**Automatic Generation**: The external LLM will generate these files directly into your Cursor environment.

**Review & Acknowledge**: After generation, always review the content of the new planX.md or updateX.md thoroughly. Ensure you understand the instructions, changes, and rationale.

**Active Reference**: Treat the latest planX.md as your primary development roadmap. Refer to it constantly as you implement features.

## 4. Collaboration & Version Control

**Commit Regularly**: After a new planX.md or updateX.md is generated and reviewed, commit it to your Git repository immediately.

**Commit Message Example**: 
- `docs: Add plan2.md for next development phase`
- `docs: Codebase analysis update2.md`

**Historical Record**: Committing these files ensures a clear, version-controlled history of your project's planning and evolution. This is invaluable for tracking decisions and understanding past states.

**Branching**: If working on a feature branch, generate and commit these files within that branch. Merge them into main (or develop) when the feature is ready.

## 5. Key Principles for Optimal Output

**Single Source of Truth**: The latest planX.md is the authoritative guide for the current development phase. Previous planX.md files are historical records.

**Feedback Loop**: Your prompts to the external LLM should explicitly reference these planX.md and updateX.md files to ensure context is maintained and built upon.

**Clarity & Precision**: The external LLM will strive for clear, strategic, step-by-step instructions in these files. If any part is unclear, ask for clarification.

**Debugging & Error Handling**: These plan files will include specific debugging mindsets and error-handling strategies relevant to the current actions. Pay close attention to these sections.

## 6. File Structure Standards

### Plan Files (planX.md) Should Include:
- **Project Overview**: Current state and goals
- **Architecture Decisions**: Technical choices and rationale
- **Implementation Phases**: Step-by-step action items
- **Dependencies**: Required packages, services, and integrations
- **Testing Strategy**: How to validate implementations
- **Debugging Guidelines**: Common issues and solutions
- **Next Steps**: Immediate priorities and timeline

### Update Files (updateX.md) Should Include:
- **Codebase Analysis**: Current implementation status
- **Discrepancies Found**: Differences between plan and reality
- **Corrections Made**: Updates to previous assumptions
- **New Discoveries**: Additional requirements or constraints
- **Cleanup Actions**: Technical debt and optimization opportunities
- **Updated Action Plan**: Revised next steps based on findings

## 7. Maintenance Guidelines

**Regular Reviews**: Schedule periodic reviews of plan/update files to ensure they remain current and actionable.

**Cross-Reference**: Always reference previous plan/update files when creating new ones to maintain continuity.

**Version Tracking**: Keep track of which plan/update version corresponds to which codebase state.

**Archive Strategy**: Move outdated plan/update files to an archive subdirectory when they're no longer actively referenced.

## 8. Best Practices for LLM Interaction

**Context Preservation**: Always mention the latest plan/update file when asking for new features or changes.

**Incremental Updates**: Request updates to existing files rather than complete rewrites when possible.

**Validation Requests**: Ask the LLM to validate that new changes align with existing plans.

**Documentation Updates**: Request updates to plan/update files when implementing significant changes.

By following these guidelines, you will maintain a well-documented, organized, and efficient development process for Amplifyd within your Cursor IDE.
