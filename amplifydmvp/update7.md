## Amplifyd Project Update 7: Cloud Functions & Rules Deployed (Manual)

This document summarizes the completion of backend Cloud Function implementation and the necessary manual deployment steps.

### 1. Completed Actions

- **Action 1.4: Cloud Functions Directory Structure & Utilities:**
    - Created `functions/src/callable`, `functions/src/webhooks`, `functions/src/utils` directories.
    - Created `functions/src/utils/types.ts`, `functions/src/utils/firebaseAdmin.ts`, `functions/src/utils/stripe.ts`, `functions/src/utils/emailService.ts`.
    - Installed `uuid` for Cloud Functions.
- **Action 1.5: Implement Core Cloud Functions (Initial Logic):**
    - Implemented `functions/src/callable/getSignedUploadUrl.ts` (for secure file uploads).
    - Implemented `functions/src/callable/createPaymentIntent.ts` (for Stripe payment initiation).
    - Implemented `functions/src/webhooks/stripe.ts` (`onPaymentSucceeded` webhook for secure submission record creation).
    - Implemented `functions/src/callable/submitReview.ts` (for reviewer review submission).
    - Implemented `functions/src/callable/getSubmissionStatusByToken.ts` (for anonymous submission tracking).
    - Implemented `functions/src/callable/updateReviewerPaidStatus.ts` (for admin payout management).
- **Action 1.6: Update Main Cloud Functions Entry Point:**
    - Modified `functions/src/index.ts` to import and export all modular functions from their new locations.
- **Action 1.8: Update Frontend TypeScript Data Models:**
    - Created `src/lib/types.ts` and consolidated core application types (`User`, `Reviewer`, `ReviewPackage`, `Submission`, `Review`, `SubmissionFormData`, `ReviewFormData`, `ProfileFormData`).
    - Updated `src/components/submission/submission-form.tsx` to import types from `src/lib/types.ts`.

### 2. Manual Tasks Completed by User

- **Deployment of Cloud Functions & Rules:**
    - Executed `firebase deploy --only functions,firestore:rules,storage:rules`.
    - Updated `storage.rules` with the provided granular rules for authenticated and signed URL uploads.
    - Configured Stripe webhook secret in Firebase environment configuration.
    - Updated Stripe Dashboard webhook URL to point to the deployed `onPaymentSucceeded` function.

### 3. Next Action: Frontend Integration

We will now move to **Phase 2: Core Frontend Integration**.

**Action 2.1: Update AuthContext.tsx (Codebase)**

This action involves reviewing and potentially updating `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` to ensure it correctly handles user roles and authentication states, especially in light of our new backend functions and modularization. This is a foundational step before building out more complex frontend flows.

I will now proceed with analyzing `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` to determine what updates are necessary.
