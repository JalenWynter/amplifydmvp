# AI Integration Details

This document outlines the current and planned integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the Amplifyd platform.

## Current Status
- The project includes initial setup for AI capabilities using Genkit and Google AI.
- Files like `src/ai/dev.ts` and `src/ai/genkit.ts` indicate the foundational structure for AI-related development.

## Key Technologies
- **Genkit**: An open-source framework by Google for building production-ready AI applications. It provides tools for:
    - Defining AI flows (sequences of model calls, data processing, and tool use).
    - Tracing and debugging AI interactions.
    - Deploying AI flows as Cloud Functions or other services.
- **Google AI**: Provides access to powerful large language models (LLMs) like Gemini.

## Planned AI Features (Roadmap - V2.0)

### 1. AI-Powered Feedback Summary
- **Concept**: Use an LLM (e.g., Gemini via Genkit) to generate an initial summary of a review based on the reviewer's scores and written feedback.
- **Workflow**: After a reviewer completes the scoring chart and provides written strengths/improvements, an AI model could draft a concise overall summary. The reviewer would then have the option to edit, refine, or accept this AI-generated summary before finalizing the review.
- **Benefit**: Speeds up the review process for reviewers and ensures consistent, high-quality summaries.

### 2. Genre Suggestion
- **Concept**: Implement an AI model that analyzes an uploaded audio track and suggests the most appropriate musical genres.
- **Workflow**: Upon audio file upload, the track would be processed by an AI model (e.g., a machine learning model trained on audio features). The suggested genres would then be presented to the artist during the submission process or to the reviewer for categorization.
- **Benefit**: Improves data accuracy, helps artists categorize their music, and assists reviewers in understanding the track's context.

### 3. "Sounds Like" Feature
- **Concept**: Develop an AI feature that compares a submitted track to a database of well-known artists or songs and suggests similar-sounding artists.
- **Workflow**: Similar to genre suggestion, the AI model would analyze the audio features of the submitted track. It would then use a similarity search or recommendation engine to find artists with a comparable sonic profile. This information could be displayed to the artist or reviewer.
- **Benefit**: Provides valuable context for reviewers, helps artists understand their market positioning, and enhances the overall platform experience.

## Development Considerations
- **Genkit Flows**: AI logic will be encapsulated in Genkit flows, allowing for modular and testable AI components.
- **Cloud Functions**: Genkit flows can be deployed as Firebase Cloud Functions, providing a scalable and serverless execution environment for AI tasks.
- **Model Selection**: Careful selection of appropriate Google AI models (e.g., Gemini Pro for text generation, specialized models for audio analysis) will be crucial.
- **Ethical AI**: Ensuring fairness, transparency, and responsible use of AI in feedback generation and analysis.

This AI integration aims to enhance the efficiency and value proposition of the Amplifyd platform for both artists and reviewers.
