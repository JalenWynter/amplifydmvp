- **Client-Side Emulator Connection**: Implemented robust client-side connection logic to Firebase Emulators, resolving previous connection issues.
- **Updated Firebase Security Rules**: Modified `firestore.rules.production` to correctly allow authenticated users to create and manage their `users` and `reviewers` documents.
- **Comprehensive Data Seeding Script (`scripts/seedFirestore.js`)**: Developed a script to populate all necessary Firestore collections (`users`, `reviewers`, `settings`, `applications`, `referralCodes`, `submissions`, `reviews`, `transactions`, `payouts`, `referralEarnings`) with sample data for testing.
- **Auth Emulator Seeding Script (`scripts/seedAuthUsers.js`)**: Created a script to programmatically create users in the Firebase Auth Emulator, streamlining authentication testing.

### Fixed
- Resolved `TypeError: auth.useEmulator is not a function` by using explicit `connectAuthEmulator` functions and ensuring client-side execution.
- Addressed persistent `403 permission error` and "User not found in database" by correcting Firestore rules and ensuring proper emulator connection.
